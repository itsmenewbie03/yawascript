| ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `yawA`  | Increment the data pointer by one (to point to the next cell to the right).                                                                                                            |
| `Yawa`  | Decrement the data pointer by one (to point to the next cell to the left).                                                                                                             |
| `yaWA`  | Increment the byte at the data pointer by one.                                                                                                                                         |
| `YAwa`  | Decrement the byte at the data pointer by one.                                                                                                                                         |
| `yawa`  | Output the byte at the data pointer.                                                                                                                                                   |
| `YAWA`  | Accept one byte of input, storing its value in the byte at the data pointer.                                                                                                           |
| `YAWa`  | If the byte at the data pointer is zero, then instead of moving the instruction pointer forward to the next command, jump it forward to the command after the matching `yAWA` command. |
| `yAWA`  | If the byte at the data pointer is nonzero, then instead of moving the instruction pointer forward to the next command, jump it back to the command after the matching `YAWa` command. |
